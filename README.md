- **Baby Tracking:** Monitor feedings, changings, and sleep schedules – because babies are as unpredictable as your in-laws.
- **Recipes:** Keep your baby food recipes organized so you can impress everyone at your next family gathering.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for busy parents who need to get things done before their next diaper change.

2. **Log Feedings:**  
   Record every feeding session with details like type, duration, and amounts. It’s like keeping a diary, but with more spit-up and less drama.

3. **Track Everything Else:**  
   Monitor sleep sessions, diaper changes, and more. Your baby's daily adventures, now neatly organized (and mildly entertaining).

4. **Review:**  
   Check out organized charts and logs of your family’s chaos. It’s proof that even amidst the madness, you’re on top of things (or at least, you think you are).

Happy tracking – may your family's life be as organized as it is unpredictable!
